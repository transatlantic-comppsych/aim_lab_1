De-identified by Jess. 

NOTE: on Gorilla, the possible age range participants could select in the clinical survey were not updated to reflect the new age range. 
Therefore, we merged age data from the Prolific demographics file into the clinical survey (questionnaire-g38y). 
The clinical survey file in this folder is the edited version with corrected age. 

Main task file was replaced on 16/08 with a version that had had the free text answers removed.
