","Again the 5PS model as mentioned for the previous vignette.  
presenting : skin problem leading to anxiety and depression 
predisposed: what is the medical/GP diagnosis if there is one, does this young person have a previous mental health history.  what has made them more vulnerable to the anxiety and depression 
precipitate - what are the triggers for the anxiety and depression.  
perpetuate - what maintains the difficulties - i.e her asking mum for reassurance and the assurance isnt enough.  What can they both do differently instead to stop this vicious cycle maintaining the anxiety.   
Protective - what positive things does the young person have in their life that they ca n do to help them to cope.","Does the young person know what is causing the condition of her skin - what treatment is she taking, for example has the GP prescribed any physical treatment, we cannot make any assumptions about anything in our assessments as this could skew the diagnosis/ context in which the difficulties present.  Does she worry about others judging her appearance, even though this may not be so apparent.  What has she tried to tell herself to manage the anxiety around her skin and the worries about others judging her - reassurance from mum seems to maintain the anxiety she has about her skin, and this seems to be tipping into depression: the frequent tearfulness, and feelings of worthlessness, stopped socialising with friends, and spends much of her time alone.  
What help does the young person want from camhs: interventions/goals. 
Parents view - what help does the parent want from camhs for their child, and whether there is a wider mental health history for this young person, or is this a first presentation to camhs, or has there been other episodes of poor mental health in the past. ",Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) ,2,,100,"If the young person has knowledge and uderstanding of: 
-  what the skin problem is
- what is likely to cause it or have caused it
- treatment options
- how to treat it 
- the severity of the skin condition i.e whether it is life long/long term

All this information collectively can help to alleviate the associated anxiety, depression, any negative judgement thoughts she has about herself, or any worries she has about others judging her, and any health anxiety about her skin condition never getting better.  

This could then be helpful for camhs to assess any residual anxiety and depression.     ",Both (young person and parent/carer/guardian),3,4 to 8,2,"Agree with the young person and the parent what you are going to treat first and the number of sessions for example 8 sessions (to start with) and review to see whether more sessions are needed to finish the work on the anxiety and the depression. 
So if doing CBT evidenced based intervention, in this case for example: the anxiety leading to the depression, which you are going to treat first: the anxiety or the depression?.  Consider gillick competence, and confidentilaity in terms of the young person's age, do they have the capacity to make decisions for themself, and agree with the young person what information to share with their parent in terms of the work/sessions.  How much would the young person like their parent to be involved in the work/sessions.  Is the work being delivered in a way in which the young person is able to understand, and sense check their understanding of the work in the sessions.  

And whether medication for anxiety and depression is appropriate to help manage the syptoms of anxiety and depression as a treatment option alongside the CBT intervention if CBT alone isnt enough to manage the anxiety and depression symptoms.","I would use CBT CYP IAPT (cognitive behaviour therapy for children and young people in access to psychological therapies) ROMS (routine outcome measures (symptom questionnaires) manual to help to monitor outcomes - shifts/improvements in the anxiety, and depression symptoms/ severity.     

I would also use CBT structured worksheets/visuals and CBT visual formulation worksheets in each respect specific to anxiety, and depression to help to assess and work through the difficulties, and for strategies to manage the anxiety or depression, for example : the get self help website can be a good rescource for CBT worksheets to use in sessions.
