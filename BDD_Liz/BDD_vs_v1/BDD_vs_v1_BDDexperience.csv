Ideally I would choose for a more experienced colleague to take such presentations, but in CAMHS teams there may not be many professionals with an expertise on BDD apart from psychology and psychiatry, and these professionals are often in high demand. I use NICE guidelines, and the DSM to assist in diagnosis and treatment queries however professional manuals can be harder to find. I have utilised the Centre for Clinical Interventions professional workbooks regularly as a result. The CCI is an Australian based clinical institute which specialists in CBT.

I also worked with parents to support them to respond in a balanced way where they reduce reassurance but increase sense of safety.
If I were to work with a young person now I would be more inclined to use an ACT approach as i have found it really difficult to establish any cognitive dissonance in BDD and and acceptance of the root of the concern being over valued ideas rather than something wrong.
However, I have also come across people where surgery/treatment has actually reduced concerns.  Therefore I think it is diffciutl to have strict guidelines on not seeing plastic surgeons/dermatolgists.  Therefore I think using an ACT approach to the young person and family decision making may help with these questions that there are not hard a fast rules for.  "

None ",None ,"BDD can present in a variety of subtle ways and can be hard to detect outright at first as BDD.  It is not uncommon sadly for young people to experience mental health problems around their body size, weight, and shape.  BDD requires specialist skills, knowledge, and experience, to assess and treat in depth, beyond surface level intervention to prevent risk increasing and compensatory behaviours to manage the BDD affecting physical health : e.g self harm, restricted eating, developing.  Assessing and treating BDD skillfully is training CAMHS services could really benefit from a great deal.  Knowledge and awareness increases early identification of and intervention for this condition.  A young person may not always say outright or be aware themselves that they have BDD.  "
