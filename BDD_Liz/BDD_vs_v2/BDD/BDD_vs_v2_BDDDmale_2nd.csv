",Cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) ,2,,30,"I would find it hard to know and everyone is different, BDD is not my area of expertise. Generally with unfounded worries like this, escalating requests for reassurance don't tend to help and may even make things worse. The young person is already reassured by others that he looks normal and it doesn't help, why would a dermatologist be different?

On the other hand, reasonably often I do work with young people - particularly neurodiverse young people - who seem to really benefit from 'professional' advice, or are able to use it to start challenging their deeply held beliefs, and for whom this advice does not generalise. Or who find it helpful to test their theories by asking people. So I could believe either if you told me, but I would tend to assume it wouldn't be helpful unless he has an actual skin condition - in fact a dermatologist cannot practically help him.",Both (young person and parent/carer/guardian),3,13 to 20,4,No but I would look at Nice guidelines as a start,None
